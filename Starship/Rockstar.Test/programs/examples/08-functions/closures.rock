Alpha takes x, y, and z
	(The national isn't properly global, because it's declared inside Alpha,
	but Beta and Gamma don't know that: as far as they're concerned it's a
	global variable because it isn't local to *them*)
	Let the national be empty
	Beta takes nothing		
		Gamma takes nothing
			Shout "Gamma: " with x, " ", y, " ", z
			Put x into the global
			Put y into the national
			Let the local be y
		End (Gamma)
		If the national is not empty shout the national
		Return Gamma
	End (Beta)
	Return Beta
End (Alpha)

Call Alpha with "global", "national", "local" into Delta
Call Delta into Epsilon
Call Epsilon (prints: Gamma: global national local)
Call Delta (prints: national)

Shout the global (prints: global)
Shout the national (prints: mysterious)
Shout the local (prints: mysterious)
