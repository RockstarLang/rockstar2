The spiral takes the fire
The moon is all over me 
Let my life be the moon over the moon
the fire was gone 
If the fire is my life 
Give back the fire

The circle is me
If the fire is the circle 
Give back my life

Until the circle is the fire
Let the moon be the fire
Let the fire be my life
Put the moon with my life into my life
Build the circle up

Give back the fire with my life

Listen to the nature
Shout the spiral taking the nature
