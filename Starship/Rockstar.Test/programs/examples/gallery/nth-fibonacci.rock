The spiral takes my soul
The moon is all over me 
Let my life be the moon over the moon
The night was gone 
If my soul is my life 
Give back the night

The circle is me
If my soul is the circle 
Give back my life

Until the circle is my soul
Let the moon be the night
Let the night be my life
Put the moon with my life into my life
Build the circle up

Give back the night with my life

Listen to the nature
Shout the spiral taking the nature
