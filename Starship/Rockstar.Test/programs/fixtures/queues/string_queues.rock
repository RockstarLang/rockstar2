My dream is diamond nightmares
Your love is meaningless to me
Rock my dream like a razorblade smile
Rock my dream with your love, your love
Shout my dream at 0
Shout my dream at 1
Shout my dream at 2
Shout my dream at 3
Shout my dream at 4

The night is empty
Until my dream is nothing
Roll my dream into the dark
Cast the dark into the fire
Let the night be the night with the fire

Shout the night
