Listen to the mountain.
It says "I am their hearts!"
Shout it!

The wind is whispering.
It says "I am their breaths!"
Shout it!

The call is deafening.
Fear is slowly overcoming us.
My eyes are full of rage.
Let them be silent. 

Soon is the final day coming.
They are waiting to give their lives.
Let it be over soon.

The dawn is upon us.
The march is shaking the ground.
The spears are like trees.
My brothers are silent.

Scream my brothers!
Rage is just!
Rage is true!
Rage!

The spears is what I will last see.
The march is what I will last hear.
The dawn is what will last caress me.

My name is the mountain!
My breath is the wind!
My faith is my name without my breath!
My story is my faith!
My life is my story!

Roll my life into a book.
Let the title be "The Final Stand"
Shout the title!
