The moon is like a kaleidoscope, out over quiet winter wonderland
The river is like a razorblade
Let my loneliness be the moon over the river
Shout my loneliness (prints: 123456)

A dream says tomorrow
A girl says no 
My heart is empty
Let it be a girl with a dream
Shout my heart (prints: no tomorrow)

The wings are like a heartbreak
the fire is like a tomb
Let the silence be the wings of the fire
Scream the silence (prints: 140)
