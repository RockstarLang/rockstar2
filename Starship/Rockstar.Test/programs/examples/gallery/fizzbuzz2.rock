Midnight takes your heart and your soul
While your heart is as high as your soul
Put your heart without your soul into your heart, baby
Give back your heart, yeah

My dreams hold diamond nightmares
Salvation holds the sea.
My screams hold silent echoes
Your love is meaningless to me

Rock my dreams like a razorblade smile
Rock my dreams with your love, your love
Rock my screams like a heartbroken missile
Rock my screams with your love, your love.

Desire is a lovestruck ladykiller
My world is nothing
Fire is ice
Hate is water
Until my world is Desire,
Build my world up
If Midnight taking my world, Fire is nothing and Midnight taking my world, Hate is nothing
Shout my dreams with my screams with salvation
Take it to the top

If Midnight taking my world, Fire is nothing
Shout my dreams with salvation
Take it to the top

If Midnight taking my world, Hate is nothing
Shout my screams with salvation
Take it to the top

Whisper my world
