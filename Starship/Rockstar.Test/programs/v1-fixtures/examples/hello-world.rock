Eternity takes forever.
my price is silence
Until forever is nothing,
Roll forever into violence,
Cast violence into your lies,
Let my price be with your lies.

Give back my price

the fire is calling me
Rock the fire like a colourcast tranquility
The dawn is a spellbound moonbeam
Rock the fire with the dawn, the dawn,
Your fire is a neverending aftereffect
Rock the fire with your fire

The spirit is electric thunder
Rock the spirit with your fire
Rock the spirit like a thunderbolt fist
Rock the spirit with the dawn
Rock the spirit like a chamaeleon stormcloud 

Let fear be eternity taking the fire
Let hope be eternity taking the spirit

Time is all up
Cast it into the void
Let fear be with the void
Let fear be with hope

Shout fear
