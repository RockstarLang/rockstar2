Batman takes a number
Rock the lyrics with "Na"
The index is 1
Until the index is higher than a number
Let the lyrics at the index be "na"
build the index up
yeah
Rock the lyrics with "BATMAN!"
give back the lyrics
yeah

Call Batman with 5 into the array
Join the array using "-" into my song
Shout my song (prints: Na-na-na-na-na-na-BATMAN!)
