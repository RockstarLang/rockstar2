Run some Rockstar:

```rockstar
# let's get rocked!
say "hello world" (yeah!)
Johnny B. Goode is 123
JRR Tolkein is 456
Let my heroes [Am] be Johnny B. Goode with [Dmaj7] JRR Tolkein
A girl is laughing
A boy is without a girl
A function takes a boy and a girl
Give back a boy with a girl

```

Well... do you wanna get rocked?
