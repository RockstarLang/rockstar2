if true print 1 (prints: 1)

when 1 is true say 1 else say 2 (prints: 1)

if nothing is true say "yeah" otherwise say "no" (prints: no)

if false otherwise print "rock on!" (prints: rock on!)

if 1 if 2 if 3 if 4 say 4 else say 3 else say 2 else say 1 else say 0 (prints: 4)
(the one-liner is done, so the next statement will always execute)
print 1 (prints: 1)
