## Examples of Rockstar Code

Rockstar is specifically designed to allow the programmer to express the same set of operations in many different ways - that's part of what makes it fun; the challenge of coming up with programs that also look like vaguely plausible rock lyrics.

This can make it kinda hard to work out exactly what's going on, so for examples, we tend to use two different styles of Rockstar code. One is what we call *minimalist Rockstar*, which avoids the more esoteric features of the language in favour of something that's clear and succint, with copious use of comments to explain what's going on. 

The other is known as *idiomatic Rockstar*, where we encourage developers to use all the capabilities of the language to create programs that are also rock songs.

### Examples

* Fizzbuzz in [idiomatic Rockstar](fizzbuzz.rock) | [minimalist Rockstar](fizzbuzz_minimalist.rock)
