My dreams hold diamond nightmares
Salvation is the sea
My screams hold silent echoes
Your love is meaningless to me

Rock my dreams like a razorblade smile
Rock my dreams with your love, your love
Rock my screams like a heartbroken missile
Rock my screams with your love, your love.

My dreams are with my screams
Rock my dreams with salvation
Whisper my dreams
