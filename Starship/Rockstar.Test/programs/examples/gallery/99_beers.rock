{Title: 99 Bottles of Beer}
{Artist: Traditional}

[D]Your heart says  bottles of beer on the wall
[G]Your soul says  bottles of beer
[A]Carol says Take one down, pass it around
[G]The beers were numbering fa'too'many
[D]While the beers ain't nothing
[G]Say it with your heart
[A]Say it with your soul
[D]Say Carol,
[A]Knock the beers down
[D]Say it with your heart
