Depression takes your hope and your light
While your hope is as high as your light
Put your hope without your light into your hope

If your hope is gone
Give back yes

Give back lies


Listen to your heart
My world is selflessness
Your faith is forgiveness
While your heart is bigger than your faith and depression taking your heart, my world
Whisper my world
Put your heart over my world into your heart

Build my world up
While your heart is bigger than your faith
While your heart is bigger than your faith and depression taking your heart, my world
Scream my world
Put your heart over my world into your heart

Build my world up, up
