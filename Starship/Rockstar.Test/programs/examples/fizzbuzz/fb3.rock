Midnight takes your heart and your soul
While your heart is as high as your soul
Put your heart without your soul into your heart, baby
Give back your heart, yeah

Desire is a lovestruck ladykiller
My world is nothing
Fire is ice
Fate is water

Until my world is desire
Build my world up
if midnight taking my world, fire is 0 and midnight taking my world, fate is 0
print "FizzBuzz"
continue
end (if)
if midnight taking my world, fate is 0
print "Buzz"
continue
end (if)
if midnight taking my world, fire is 0
print "Fizz"
continue
end (if)
print my world
end (while)
