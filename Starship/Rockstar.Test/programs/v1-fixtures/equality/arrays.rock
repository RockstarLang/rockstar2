rock first with 0, 1, 2
rock second with 3, 4, 5

if first ain't second
say "arrays of the same length but different contents are not equal"

ArrayCopy takes source
rock dest
let i be 0
let len be source + 0
while i is less than len
let dest at i be source at i
build i up

return dest

let First Copy be ArrayCopy taking first
if First Copy is first
say "element-wise-copied arrays are equal"

let Second Copy be second
if Second Copy is second
say "assignment-copied arrays are equal"

rock First Nested with first, second
rock Second Nested with first, second
if First Nested is Second Nested
say "nested arrays with the same contents are equal"

rock Third Nested with first, second
rock Fourth Nested with second, first
if Third Nested ain't Fourth Nested
say "nested arrays with different contents are not equal"
