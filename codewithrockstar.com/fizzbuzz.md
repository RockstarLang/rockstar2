# FizzBuzz like a Rockstar

I'm sure you've heard of Fizzbuzz. It's a kids' game from school that's become a staple of tech interviews and coding tests:

* Print the numbers from 1 to 100 inclusive
* If a number is divisible by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
* If a number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
* If a number if divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
* Otherwise, just print the number

In this tutorial, we'll start off with Fizzbuzz implemented in what's known as **minimalist Rockstar** -- which looks a bit like Python with no indentation -- and step-by-step we'll convert it to **idiomatic Rockstar**, which is more Whitesnake than Python.

Here's Fizzbuzz in minimalist Rockstar:
