Music takes fantasy and skill
The world is my heaven
Put fantasy without skill into oblivion
If she is less than nothing or she is as big as the world
Give back fantasy

Fear is a lie
If oblivion is weaker than fear
Let fantasy be with the world

Let fantasy be without fear
Give back fantasy

Dreams were bloody great
Chords were on brain waves
While chords ain't gone
Cast chords into a guitar
Put music taking chords & dreams into shape
A song is necessary comfort
Let harmony be music taking shape, a song
Cast harmony into magic
Let the chords at a guitar be magic
Knock chords down

Your will is tremendous
Listen to your dreams
Shatter them into feel
While your will ain't feel
Put feel at your will into a guitar
Let magic be the chords at a guitar
Let feel at your will be magic
Build your will up

Join feel into the music
Shout it
