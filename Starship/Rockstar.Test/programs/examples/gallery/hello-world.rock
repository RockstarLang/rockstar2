Eternity takes forever; my price is silence
Until forever is nothing; roll it into violence
Cast violence into my soul
Let my price be with my soul, baby
Give back my price

The night is calling me
Rock it like a shadowclad tranquility
The dream is a spellbound moonbeam
Your love is a neverending bewitchment
Rock the night with the dream, the dream,
Rock the night with your love

Control is illusion tangled
Rock it with your love
Rock it like a thunderbolt fire
Rock it with the dream
Rock it like a stormcloud dreamspire

Let desire be eternity taking my soul
Let the light be eternity taking control

Time is like the storm-shadow
Cast it into the night
Let desire be with the night
Let desire be with the light
Whisper desire
