X is 5

If x <= 5 print "Tony"
If x < 6 print "Geezer"
if x > 4 print "Bill"

My heart is crying
The sky is on fire
If the sky is greater than my heart print "Vince"
If the sky is as high as my heart print "Mick"
If my heart is weaker than the sky print "Nikki"
If my heart is as low as the sky print "Tommy"
