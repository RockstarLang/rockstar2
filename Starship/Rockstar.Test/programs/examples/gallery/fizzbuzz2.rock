Midnight takes your heart and your soul
While your heart is as high as your soul
Put your heart without your soul into your heart, baby
Give back your heart, yeah

My dreams hold diamond nightmares
Salvation holds the sea
The night holds silent echoes
Your love is meaningless to me

Rock my dreams like a lovestruck smile
Rock my dreams with your love, your love
Rock the night like a switchblade missile
Rock the night with your love, your love.

Desire is a lovestruck ladykiller
My world is nothing
Fire is ice
The sky is cryin'
Until my world is desire,
Build my world up
If midnight taking my world, fire is nothing and midnight taking my world, and the sky is nothing
Shout my dreams with the night with salvation
Take my heart, baby
If midnight taking my world, fire is nothing
Shout my dreams with salvation
Take my dreams, baby
If midnight taking my world, the sky is nothing
Shout the night with salvation
Take the night, yeah
Whisper my world
