The World takes your heart and your soul
While your heart is as high as your soul
Put your heart without your soul into your heart

Give back your heart

War takes your life
Your blood is ice
Their Fight is up
Knock it down
If your life without your blood is as low as gone
Give back your life is stronger than Their Fight

Your time is up
Put The World taking your life & your time into Their Place
Build your time up
Put The World taking your life & your time into Your Place
If Their Place is empty or Your Place is empty 
Your path was wrong
Give back your path

Build your time up
Build your time up
Their Time is up
Your blood is ice
Until your time of your time is greater than your life
Put The World taking your life & your time into Their Place
Put your time with Their Time into your mind
Put The World taking your life & your mind into your place
If Their Place is empty or your place is empty 
Your path was wrong
Give back your path

Put your time with your blood with your blood into your time

Your path was right
Give back your path


Listen to the crowd
My voice is gone
Build my voice up
Until my voice is as strong as the crowd
Build my voice up
If War taking my voice
Shout my voice
