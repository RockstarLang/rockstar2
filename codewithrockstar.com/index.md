# Rockstar 2.0 Beta

Everything here is work in progress.

### What's here?

* Rockstar 2.0 language spec
* Rockstar interactive interpreter

The Rockstar engine has been completely rebuilt in .NET, and
is running here as a web assembly (WASM) binary.

Browser around, try some stuff, let me know what you find.
